CODENAME: GOODGAME by JetBoom

EXTREMELY early alpha. If you see or hear things from other games then that's because I stole it as a placeholder.

You can revive people with the Battle Revive ability (requires staff out). A regular revive, regular gank, and the soul flay spell will be added later.
Also a bit of a bug: jumping off the map will perma kill you until reconnect.

There's no commands or UI for changing school abilities yet so you'll get a starter batch for testing.

Some notes on camera perspectives. Different perspectives do not change where projectiles come from like in df. They will always appear out of the character's aim position (their face or so). So over the shoulder will alter your shots to bend to the left or right depending on where the crosshair is pointing. Melee does not do this and always is straight ahead. First person just cuts your head off so you can see out of it.


As for what the overall game plan is, there's going to be two branches to the game. Oh and servers will be player hosted. This isn't an MMO.
1. Quick play with CTF, duel, deathmatch. Standard things designed for small 16 player servers or so. Drop in and fight with standard weapons/armor. Pick your builds ofc. POSSIBLY a ranked matchmaking mode using official servers. This would be made before 2.
2. The "main" attraction. A sort of a microcosm of what darkfall was but without any character grind.
I was thinking making maps for this like the size of one of df's subcontinents. People could form their own teams or be put in to large premade ones. Not sure.
Maybe it would be round based and also have a sandbox mode with no winning condition. This mode would have the ability to farm for and use stronger weapons and armor.

I'm not sure how many players a UE4 dedicated server can support without shitting the bed but if we go off of ARK (it's UE4) it's about 100 players for that game. Keep in mind there's not hundreds of NPCs, minecraft block building, a super complex map, or super complex calculations going on so that number might be closer to 150. Which is more players than you would find on df at a time anyway. If there were any building it would be limited to full scale models instead of minecraft blocks.

I think it would be great to have a game the scale of ARK or Reign of Kings but not bad. I'm one person and I'm focusing all my efforts on good gameplay first and foremost, that's why everything is using placeholder artwork/sounds.
